    <h3>Work Experience</h3>

    <p> <strong>Online Content Creator/Artist/Voice Actor
      YouTube (2015-Present).</strong>
      <br>
      For the last six years, I have been honing many skills while
      working on my passion projects online. I have written over
      200 stories and created fully-produced video products based
      on them. Each project features voice acting, sound design,
      video editing, motion graphics, and various kinds of digital
      art. I have used skills such as branding, search engine
      optimization (SEO), and social media marketing to get my
      videos and personally-branded merchandise out to my over
      25,000 followers across multiple platforms. With my online
      work, I use my creative writing, art, and content creation
      skills to create engaging, immersive content that has amassed
      over 1.3 million views, driven brand merchandise sales, and
      lead to collaborations with major YouTube personalities in
      my genre.
